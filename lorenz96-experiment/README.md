# Main code
The main code for training the model and calculating prediction intervals to reproduce the results of Section 4 of the paper is `run_L96_model.ipynb`. 
The training, testing, and calibration data used for these experiments is available at [here on Box](https://uchicago.box.com/s/eln1twrzfvxldadkjamu6cym0bhsgfeo). 

# Optional -- to generate new data
If you wish to generate new data (e.g., with a different forcing parameter $F$), you will need to use `l96_data.py`. However, if you download the above dataset, you do not need to generate new data.
