The main code for training the model and calculating prediction intervals to reproduce the results of Section 4 of the paper is run_L96_model.ipynb. 
The training, testing, and calibration data used for these experiments is available at https://uchicago.box.com/s/eln1twrzfvxldadkjamu6cym0bhsgfeo. 

If you wish to generate new data (e.g., with a different forcing parameter F), you will need to use l96_data.py. However, if you download the above dataset, you do not need to generate new data.
